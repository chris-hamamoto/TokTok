	<div class="text question">
		<p>
			What are some important things for a young designer to consider when making their portfolio?
		</p>
	</div>		

	<div class="text answer">
		<p>
			Consider your desired audience — what is your dream client/studio, and what kind of projects do you want to be hired to do? Most of the time, clients and companies are risk-averse and they want to hire designers that they know that can do the kind of projects they usually do. So just as a quick example, if your dream client is to work for a newspaper or magazine, it doesn’t hurt to make your portfolio lean towards print projects, even if they’re mostly self-initiated and aren’t “real” projects. A lot of students get scared that they don’t have “real” projects or job experience to show — that’s fine, just make your own projects, and document them. It’s the surest way to worm your way into a real job involving those sorts of projects. If you do it, they will come.

	<div class="text question">
		<p>
			How did you decide your career path?
		</p>
	</div>	

	<div class="text answer">
		<p>
			I studied political philosophy in college. I loved studying it but couldn’t see myself in any sort of job that involved politics. I got involved with a bunch of arts and design organizations on campus and quickly realized that was what I wanted to do for a living.

	<div class="text question">
		<p>
			How did you get started in your first job after school?
		</p>
	</div>	

	<div class="text answer">
		<p>
			I applied to a bunch of studios in New York City with my portfolio that was mostly composed of self-initiated projects since I didn't have a traditional design school portfolio. My first gig ever was as a freelance designer for &Walsh. That was how I got my foot in the door!

	</div>		

	<div class="text question">
		<p>
			How were you able to find your style?
		</p>
	</div>	

	<div class="text answer">
		<p>
			I don't know if I really have a style! I love trying new things and experimenting with new methods. As an art director, I'm also very open to collaborating with artists of various different styles.

	<div class="text question">
		<p>
			What is important for a designer to consider when establishing their career path?
		</p>
	</div>	

	<div class="text answer">
		<p>
			Stay focused on yourself and try to ignore any outside noise or comparing yourself to your peers. Try to hone in on what exactly excites you most about design and try to find ways of incorporating those parts that excite you into your career. It doesn't have to be in the form of a full-time job either, if it's something independent on the side that you like to do, then find a job that is able to financially support you while you chase down the things that make you happy.

	<div class="text question">
		<p>
			Looking back to when you graduated from school, what's one thing you know now that you wish you knew then?
		</p>
	</div>	

	<div class="text answer">
		<p>
			The importance of networking is far overblown.
		</p>
	</div>	

	<div class="text question">
		<p>
			When you were a student, how did you find inspiration with your own work? How did you get through burnouts or artblocks?
		</p>
	</div>	

	<div class="text answer">
		<p>
			I didn't have a traditional design school education, but I do suffer from a lot of burnout and occasionally creative blocks now. When that happens, I try to just give myself space and keep myself from thinking about the project 24/7. The idea usually comes to me after a bit, naturally.

	<div class="text question">
		<p>
			And finally, serif or sans serif?
		</p>
	</div>	

	<div class="text answer">
		<p>
			Lol both
