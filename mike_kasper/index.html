			Suzy decided to talk to Mike Kasper.
		</p>
	</div>	
	<div class="text answer intro">
		<p>
			Mike Kasper is a production designer in Calgary, Alberta.
		</p>
	</div>	
	<div class="text question">
		<p>
			Firstly, please can you tell us a little about your job and what you do?
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="text answer">
		<p>
			Hello, My name is Mike Kasper and I work in film and television primarily as a Production designer in Calgary, Alberta. I have also been contracted to be an Art Director many times as well.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a Production Designer, I have the duty to design the visual elements of a project consisting of the set decoration, props, and graphic design elements (Wall art, phone screens, etc.) This entails the planning process and seeing the project to completion. Often, this can also include pre-production items such as storyboarding and concept art.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="text question">
		<p>
			How did you get started working in your field?
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="text answer">
		<p>
			I started working in this field due to two major reasons, passion and necessity.
		</p>
		<p>
			First off, I have a long-time passion for the fine arts and digital arts. I have a background in Art History which facilities the needs of my role in numerous ways. Also, I have always been drawn the art of filmmaking as I see it as an ever-evolving medium with very few restrictions.
		</p>
		<p>
			Secondly, necessity. Once I had my foot in the door, being on film sets, I saw a great need for designers as it is not a common career path in the industry. Once I became aware of this, it felt like the correct path for me to take.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="text question">
		<p>
			What are some of the projects you’ve worked on?
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="text answer">
		<p>
			Some notable projects I have designed would be:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Still/Born (2016)</b> A horror film dealing with the loss of a newborn and demonic possession.</li>
			<li><b>Z (2018)</b>A horror film about a child and his otherworldly imaginary friend.</li>
			<li><b>Eye of Urm (2018)</b>A psychological sci-fi delving into post-futurism and human connection.</li>
			<li><b>Bloodthirsty (2020)</b>Horror film dealing with a musician turned werewolf.</li>
			<li><b>The Ties That Bind (2022)</b>1930s period piece. Canadiana melodrama.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>


	<div class="text question">
		<p>
			How would you describe your workflow and process?
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="text answer">
		<p>
			My workflow for digital projects on films would be as follows:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Become familiar with the most recent version of the script.</li>
			<li>Create a breakdown with all the graphics required of the film. Be as detailed as possible.</li>
			<li>Create a digital piece and present it to the Director and D.O.P. Make sure to discuss what mediums will be used to display the graphics. Is it a screen of some kind? Those require camera tests. Is it being printed in something large format? Those tend to have a shine to them which should be discussed.</li>
			<li>It may also be required to present the piece to a producer or network for approval.</li>
			<li>After all parties are happy with the decisions, screen graphics will be transferred to their designated props (phones or laptops) and print media will be processed. Sometimes I will print a test copy if it is something that we need many copies of (period-specific money for example).</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div class="text question">
		<p>
			What qualities and skills make a good graphic designer working in film?
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="text answer">
		<p>
			The qualities of a good designer working in film to me are:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Punctual and good time management</li>
			<li>Ability to communicate with others well</li>
			<li>Able to take criticism</li>
			<li>Good work ethic</li>
			<li>Understanding of the fact that this is an always-learning type of job and there are many different routes to success</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The skills I look for are:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Drivers license (runs to the print house are to be expected)</li>
			<li>Ability to use Photoshop and/or Illustrator</li>
			<li>Knowledge of Excel worksheets</li>
			<li>Ability to seek out the proper resources available online</li>
			<li>Knowledge of print mediums</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div class="text question">
		<p>
			What are some of the biggest challenges you face in your field?
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="text answer">
		<p>
			Some of the biggest challenges I face in my field are:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The disagreement between parties. Sometimes the director and the designer see very different versions of something in their heads.</li>
			<li>Timelines. Working on films (especially independent films) usually has very strict timelines in place. Therefore some projects might feel "rushed out the door".</li>
			<li>Budgets. This one is definitely more of a problem with independent films or serialized television. Often there is just enough budget to get through a project and proper budget breakdowns may be more important than one thinks.</li>
			<li>Availability. Finding the right people for the project can also be a bit stressful in the early days of a project.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div class="text question">
		<p>
			As a graphic designer working in film, what would you look for in a portfolio? What makes a good portfolio?
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="text answer">
		<p>
			When I look through portfolios I am looking for:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Variety of projects (phone screens, web browsers, artwork, logos, etc.)</li>
			<li>A variety of mediums (print, any post-processing like texture, screens, paint, etc.)</li>
			<li>Tidiness of presentation of portfolio.</li>
			<li>Projection of the personality of the designer. Make it your own and have fun with it.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>A good portfolio can be many things but I think it needs to have personality, professionalism, and competence all equally on display.</p>
	</div>	

	<div class="text question">
		<p>
			Would you say it's better to have a more diverse portfolio or a more straightforward one when applying for a position?
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="text answer">
		<p>
			I think a diverse portfolio always makes a better impression on myself. I think trying to be more straightforward in an application by presenting what "the project is looking for" can trip you up in a few ways. Perhaps this might not be your strong point of design but other projects you may leave off your portfolio could make up for the shortcomings. Another reason could be you may have just not had much experience with the type of project before and your other works might relay your actual experience level.
		</p>
		<p>
			Another reason diverse portfolios are great is that film projects are ever-flowing and a new one pops up eventually. They all have different design needs. Perhaps one portfolio submission will actually get you to work on a different project.
