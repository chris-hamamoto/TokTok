			Working in a studio seems to be more fulfilling and fun because the work I did is well revealed. However, there is a burden because personal competency is really important. Since there are no other employees, it is a bit cumbersome because I have to communicate and write estimates myself in addition to the design.

			While working on my graduation exhibition, I had a regret that I should have done all the things I wanted to experiment with. I think it would be best to make sure and do those things that can only be done when you are a student. It was also really important to find my interests and tastes. This is because I don't have enough time to start exploring new things after graduating from school.
