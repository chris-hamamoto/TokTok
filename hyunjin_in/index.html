		<p>
			Seonhyeong decided to talk to Hyunjin.
		</p>
	</div>	

	<div class="text answer intro">
		<p>
			Hyunjin In is Graphic Designer and Freelance Graphic Designer.
		</p>
	</div>	

	<div class="text question">
		<p>
			What is your current job?
		</p>
	</div>		
	<div class="text answer">
		<p>
			Along with Shin-Shin, I work on graphic design and editorial design, and I also work as a freelance designer. I mainly work in the fields of culture and arts, such as exhibition art collection, exhibition identity, and application work.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="text question">
		<p>
			What kind of work do you usually do?
		</p>
	</div>	

	<div class="text answer">
		<p>
			I am interested in designing in accordance with the structure of the book by using text or images. In many cases, I get commissions from text producers.
		</p>
	</div>		

	<div class="text question">
		<p>
			How did you decide your career path?
		</p>
	</div>	

	<div class="text answer">
		<p>
			The micro-typography I learned in the typography class was really fun. As I continued to deal with editorial design and typography in my school’s typography club, I decided I wanted to work in an editorial-focused agency or studio.
		</p>
	</div>		

	<div class="text question">
		<p>
			How was your internship experience?
		</p>
	</div>	

	<div class="text answer">
		<p>
			It helped me gain the confidence to think that I’m cut out for working at a studio. Since studios have a wide range of work that each individuals may do, I enjoy that the projects we're working on keeps changing and the atmosphere is open.
		</p>
	</div>		
	
	<div class="text question">
		<p>
			Which do you prefer, company or agency?
		</p>
	</div>	

	<div class="text answer">
		<p>
			Working in a studio seems to be more fulfilling and fun because the work I did is well revealed. However, there is a burden because personal competency is really important. Since there are no other employees, it is a bit cumbersome because I have to communicate and write estimates myself in addition to the design.
		</p>
	</div>	

	<div class="text question">
		<p>
			Looking back to when you graduated from school, what's one thing you know now that you wish you knew then?
		</p>
	</div>	

	<div class="text answer">
		<p>
			While working on my graduation exhibition, I had a regret that I should have done all the things I wanted to experiment with. I think it would be best to make sure and do those things that can only be done when you are a student. It was also really important to find my interests and tastes. This is because I don't have enough time to start exploring new things after graduating from school.
