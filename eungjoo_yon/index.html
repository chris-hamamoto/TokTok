	<div class="text question">

			What are some important things for a young designer to consider when making their portfolio? 
		</p>

	<div class="text answer">

			I think it is important to understand the company before submitting the portfolio. Portfolio is for expressing yourself. it's kind of a resume for employment or economic activity after all, right? Therefore, there will be an integrated portfolio including all work. Instead of submitting the portfolio in the same format, It is important to reorganize the style of the institution you want to apply for and the ability related to the job you want. Rather than showing everything youâ€™ve done, Strategically, I think we should construct a portfolio with probability, with the thought of "how will it be effective to express myself?"

		<p>
			How did you decide your career path?
		</p>
	</div>	

	<div class="text answer">
		<p>
			I wanted to earn money as soon as I graduated, and it was a time when I busily jumped into the field without having any time to think about what I really wanted to be. About a year later, I wanted to be a person who participates in theoretical design studies and ongoing design discussions that are discussed today in academia, rather than in field work. That's why I decided to become a student studying for a Master's degree , and I'm planning to build my career with these activities in the future because I like the classes I'm taking and the research activities I'm conducting are something that makes me feel interested.

	<div class="text question">
		<p>
			How did you get started in your first job after school?
		</p>
	</div>	

	<div class="text answer">
		<p>
			I worked for an architecture and interior design company after graduation. It's a bit embarrassing to say, but I wasn't eager to work there. When I was an undergraduate, I studied in the major of Culture & Formative Design and had excellent grades within the department, so I could get a chance to take the teaching profession courses. So I was able to have time to think about teaching teenagers. So I went to the teaching practice when I was a senior. When I was considering my job, I thought about being a teacher in middle and high school, but I felt burdened by the fact that I had to be an important person in their lives for students who were so affected by teachers. Teachers can be so influential in their lives. So I got a teacherâ€™s license, but I didn't get a job to be a teacher. I got a job by utilizing my major in design.

			I think they should do something that interests them and makes them feel happy. But when we put it in a portfolio, we have to be able to show consistency and probability. Of course, it would be nice if we could plan from the beginning and use our own career in a well-made storyline, but some people take a long time to find out where their happiness is. I think young people can experience a variety of things. The field of design is very wide and diverse, but design majors don't necessarily get a job based on what they learned in school. If you learned the skill of design, you can apply it in various fields of design.

	<div class="text question">
		<p>
			Looking back to when you graduated from school, what's one thing you know now that you wish you knew then?
		</p>
	</div>	

	<div class="text answer">
		<p>
			Professors are just advisers? ðŸ˜‚ Iâ€™m not saying donâ€™t respect them, but they donâ€™t always give you the right direction. There are so many experts who are working in their fields, So students have to look for someone who can really give them worthy advice.
