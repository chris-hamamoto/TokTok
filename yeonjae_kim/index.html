			Seonhyeong decided to talk to Yeonjae.

	<div class="text answer intro">
		<p>
			Yeonjae Kim who is working at a Design Internship on the Karrot BX team.
		</p>
	</div>	

	<div class="text question">
		<p>
			What is your current job?
		</p>
	</div>		
	<div class="text answer">
		<p>
			I'm working as an intern designer for the Karrot BX team. I make graphic artworks, such as designing images for content published in collaboration with the marketing teams.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="text question">
		<p>
			What kind of work do you usually do?
		</p>
	</div>	

	<div class="text answer">
		<p>
			I try to work with content that I have seen from time to time and has impressed me, and I am mainly interested in text and food culture.
		</p>
	</div>		

	<div class="text question">
		<p>
			How did you decide your career path?
		</p>
	</div>	

	<div class="text answer">
		<p>
			While doing various activities during my undergraduate life, I wanted to work with the senses rather than logic. I think branding is attractive because it can touch on many media and it is difficult to predict, so I wanted to start my first job with graphics or branding.
		</p>
	</div>		

	<div class="text question">
		<p>
			How was your internship experience?
		</p>
	</div>	

	<div class="text answer">
		<p>
			I could learn a lot from senior designers. The BX team is a small organization of about 10 people, so each person has a lot of work to do. I think it is interesting that the speed of work is fast and changes continuously.
		</p>
	</div>		
	
	<div class="text question">
		<p>
			Which do you prefer, company or agency?
		</p>
	</div>	

	<div class="text answer">
		<p>
			I think it would be okay to work for a company because the internship of Karro BX designer is more fun than I expected, but I also want to work for an agency. Wherever I go, I want to go to a place where my contribution to a project is visible.

	<div class="text question">
		<p>
			Looking back to when you graduated from school, what's one thing you know now that you wish you knew then?
		</p>
	</div>	

	<div class="text answer">
		<p>
		While creating my portfolio, I saw many things that I wanted to develop in the previous assignments I did in class. I thought it would have been nice if I had more experience doing my best as an undergraduate and doing assignments until I was able to do it. And when I have an interview with a new designer, I ask them about what they like besides design. Even if you have a lot of things that you like, it is not easy to answer in a fun way when you are asked on the spot. I think it's really important to think about specifically what you like, and be able to share that.

		<p>
			Looking back to when you graduated from school, what's one thing you know now that you wish you knew then?
		</p>
	</div>	

	<div class="text answer">
		<p>
			I think it's important whether it's fun or if my work is revealed well.
		</p>
	</div>	

	<div class="text question">
		<p>
			About what parts were you strict while making your portfolio?
		</p>
	</div>	

	<div class="text answer">
		<p>
			Rather than creating a portfolio that suits the company, I wanted to create a portfolio that showed my work and myself well. Above all, it seems important that the work itself is delivered well within a limited numbers of pages. While also designing the typography so that it did not interfere with viewing the work, and controlling the strength and weakness of the image. I paid attention to whether the portfolio would read naturally without being boring. Especially, I think photography is especially important. It's better to use ok photography than an awkward mockup that is very precise.

	<div class="text question">
		<p>
			What are some important things for a young designer to consider when making their portfolio?
		</p>
	</div>	

	<div class="text answer">
		<p>
			Your portfolio  should show honestly that "I finished this work with this idea." I think it's most important to show my potential and communicate frankly.
